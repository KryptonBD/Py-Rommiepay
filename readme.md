# RoomiePay

RoomiePay is a simple Python application that helps roommates (or "flatmates") fairly split a shared bill based on the number of days each person stayed in the shared living space. It calculates the amount each flatmate owes and generates a PDF report for easy reference.

## Features

- Flexible Flatmate Management: Add as many flatmates as needed.
- Fair Bill Splitting: Calculates each flatmate's share based on the days stayed.
- PDF Report Generation: Generates a neatly formatted PDF report of the bill split.

## Example Usage

```bash
Please Enter Total amount: 1480
